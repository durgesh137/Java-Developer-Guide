/**
 * Pattern Documentation Template
 *
 * This package contains reusable patterns and techniques identified while solving
 * LeetCode sorting problems. Each pattern file documents:
 *
 * 1. Pattern Description - What is this pattern?
 * 2. When to Use - Problem characteristics that indicate this pattern
 * 3. Implementation Template - Reusable code structure
 * 4. Example Problems - Which problems use this pattern
 * 5. Complexity Analysis - Time and space implications
 * 6. Variations - Different forms of the pattern
 * 7. Common Pitfalls - What to watch out for
 *
 * Patterns to be documented as problems are solved:
 * - TwoPointerPattern.java
 * - FrequencyCountPattern.java
 * - CustomComparatorPattern.java
 * - GreedyApproachPattern.java
 * - BucketSortPattern.java
 * - PartitionPattern.java
 * - MergePattern.java
 * - BinarySearchPattern.java
 * - InPlaceTransformPattern.java
 * - MathOptimizationPattern.java
 *
 * Each pattern will be extracted as common solutions emerge across problems.
