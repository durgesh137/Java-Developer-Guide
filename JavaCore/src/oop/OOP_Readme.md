# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This folder contains documentation and code examples for core OOP principles used in Java.

## Core OOP Principles

### [Encapsulation](./encapsulation/encapsulation.md)
Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction through methods.
- Data hiding & access control
- Getters/setters
- Validation

### [Inheritance](./inheritance/inheritance.md)
Reusing and extending existing types.
- Code reusability & hierarchy
- Method overriding
- Super keyword

### [Polymorphism](./polymorphism/polymorphism.md)
Using a single interface to represent different underlying types.
- Runtime & compile-time polymorphism
- Method overloading & overriding
- Dynamic dispatch

### [Abstraction](./abstraction/abstraction.md)
Exposing only relevant features and hiding implementation details.
- Abstract classes & interfaces
- Contract-based programming
- When to use what

## Notes
- Each principle has its own folder with detailed README and code examples.
- Practice the examples and modify them to strengthen understanding.
- Review the code comments for best practices and common pitfalls.
