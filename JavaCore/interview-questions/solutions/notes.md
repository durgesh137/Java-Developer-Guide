## Idempotent API Design - questions
Q35. What is an idempotent API?
Q32- How do you design idempotent APIs?
Q. How does it ensure for each request same request ID is used/generated? But in this case multiple times user clicks on save button?
Q33- When does this unique request ID get generated? Normally on the UI, there is not any section which says unique Id is generated, so this should be handled from
UI code only?
Q34- How to enable unique key constraint on prevent duplicate entries in the database? Say For creating user how to ensure duplicate user is not created?
Q. Why is idempotency important in microservices?
