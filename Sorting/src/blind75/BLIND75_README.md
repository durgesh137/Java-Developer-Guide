## Array Problems

### [Problem 1: Two Sum](docs/TwoSum_README.md)
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Solution Approach:** Hash Map (One-Pass)  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

### [Problem 15: 3Sum](docs/ThreeSum_README.md)
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Array, Two Pointers, Sorting

Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that they sum to zero. The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Solution Approach:** Sort + Two Pointers  
**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### [Problem 128: Longest Consecutive Sequence](docs/LongestConsecutiveSequence_README.md)
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Array, Hash Table, Union Find

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

**Solution Approach:** Hash Set with Smart Iteration  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

## String Problems

### [Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](docs/LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingChars_README.md)
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** String, Sliding Window, Hash Table

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Solution Approach:** Sliding Window with Character Index Array  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### [Problem 5: Longest Palindromic Substring](docs/LongestPalindromeSubstring_README.md)
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** String, Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

**Solution Approach:** Expand Around Center  
**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
