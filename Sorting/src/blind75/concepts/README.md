## 📚 Concepts Library

### Data Structures & Language Features

1. **[char as Array Index](./char_as_array_index_explained.md)**
   - Understanding how `char` is a numeric type in Java
   - ASCII value mapping to array indices
   - Why `int[128]` is used for character tracking
   - O(1) lookup efficiency
   - **Used in:** Problem 3 (Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)

### Algorithmic Patterns

2. **Two Pointer Technique**
   - Using two pointers to traverse arrays efficiently
   - Opposite direction pointers (start and end)
   - Same direction pointers (slow and fast)
   - Optimal for sorted arrays and finding pairs/triplets
   - **Used in:** Problem 15 (3Sum), Problem 1 (Two Sum variant)
